=head1 NAME

Finance::Bank::Bankwest::SessionFromLogin - create a session using a PAN and access code

=head1 VERSION

This module is part of distribution Finance-Bank-Bankwest v1.2.5.

This distribution's version numbering follows the conventions defined at L<semver.org|http://semver.org/>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $from_login = Finance::Bank::Bankwest::SessionFromLogin->new(
        pan         => 12345678,
        access_code => 'LetMeIn123',
    );
    # returns a Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Session object
    my $session = $from_login->session;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module logs into Bankwest Online Banking using a supplied PAN
(Personal Access Number) and access code, and sets up a
L<Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Session> object with the newly-created
session.

L<Finance::Bank::Bankwest/login> provides a slightly more convenient
wrapper for this functionality.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 pan

The Personal Access Number (PAN).  Required.

=head2 access_code

The access code associated with the provided PAN.  Required.

=head2 session

If login with the provided credentials is successful, a
L<Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Session> instance.

May throw one of the following exceptions on failure:

=over 4

=item L<Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Error::NotLoggedIn::BadCredentials>

if the remote server rejects the supplied PAN/access code combination.

=item L<Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Error::NotLoggedIn::UnknownReason>

or

=item L<Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Error::BadResponse>

if the remote server returns something unexpected, such as an "offline
for maintenance" message or some sort of intermediate advertising
pop-up.  In both cases the remote server's response is available as an
L<HTTP::Response> object; see
L<Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Error::WithResponse/response>.

=back

=head2 login_uri

The location of the resource that accepts the provided PAN and access
code and establishes the banking session.  Use the default value during
normal operation.
