This distribution's version numbering follows the conventions defined at L<semver.org|http://semver.org/>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This exception may be thrown on calls to
L<Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Session/transactions> when the Bankwest
Online Banking server declines to action a transaction export request
for a reason that cannot be programmatically determined.

It is also internally thrown when the transaction search form is loaded
for the first time, but then caught since this is an anticipated event.
