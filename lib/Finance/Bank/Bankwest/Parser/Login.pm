=head1 NAME

Finance::Bank::Bankwest::Parser::Login - Online Banking login web page parser

=head1 VERSION

This module is part of distribution Finance-Bank-Bankwest v1.0.0.

This distribution's version numbering follows the conventions defined at L<semver.org|http://semver.org/>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module holds the logic for identifying an L<HTTP::Response> object
as a Bankwest Online Banking login web page, and throwing appropriate
exceptions when the page indicates that something has gone wrong (e.g.
session timeout, subsequent login, bad credentials).

This module always throws an exception regardless of the content of the
response, on the basis that being presented with a login page during a
session is almost always a bad thing.  In the one foreseeable case when
a login page is good--logging in--the caller can simply catch the
exception and proceed as normal.
